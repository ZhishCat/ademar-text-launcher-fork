# TextLauncher

Source: https://gitlab.com/ademar111190/textlauncher

I removed unnecessary value directories from app/src/main/res (in my case of use) and a search field. I don't know how to code, so I used Android Studio to modify the source code. There might be some unnecessary bloat in the code due to the "smart implementation" feature in Android Studio.
